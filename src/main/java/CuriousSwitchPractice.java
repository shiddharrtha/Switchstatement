        //we have seen if-else and if-else if conditions

        //we can achieve similar result with another type of statement
        //a switch statement checks a single value against multiple cases
        //to find a match or not
        //syntax is
        //switch which is a keyword
        //(expression) which hold the value we will check, expression can be any variable or literal
        //case which is a keyword
        //value_for_case: checks the expression against this
        //statements to happen is the expression matches a case
        //break; keyword to leave the switch and avoid unintended consequences
        //default: keyword and case that happens if no match is found, like an else statement



        //if we forget to use this keyword we will end up falling through the cases until we hit a break


        //we can test multiple cases for the same result
        //if any of the cases match we will implement that result
